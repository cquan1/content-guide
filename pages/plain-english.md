**Write content in clear, simple terms. Avoid wordy descriptions and jargon.**

City of Lexington websites are for everyone in the City. The content they contain should therefore be as straightforward as possible.

Donâ€™t use formal or long words when easy or short ones will do. Use buy instead of purchase, help instead of assist, about instead of approximately, and so on.

**Write conversationally.** 

Picture your audience and write as if you were talking to them one-on-one and with the authority of someone who can actively help.


**Active Voice**

Avoid being passive, whenever possible. The active voice allows the reader to more easily identify each sentence's subject. Active voice also tends to make for shorter, more palpable writing, since it is so simple and straight to the point. 

> *	**_Active voice_:** 
>> *The subject of the sentence is doing the action.*
>> *The clerk was helping the customer.*
>> *The director wrote the report yesterday.*

> *	**_Passive voice_**: 
>> *The subject of the sentence is now being acted upon.*
>> *The customer was being helped (by the clerk).*
>> *The report was written yesterday (by the director)*


**Hemingway Editor** 

Use the [Hemingway Editor](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) to make sure your content is readable to an eight grade level. This will help you audience absorb the information you are sharing.
