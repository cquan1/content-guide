**Write content in clear, simple terms. Avoid wordy descriptions and jargon.**

City of Lexington websites are for everyone in the City. The content they contain should therefore be as straightforward as possible.

Donâ€™t use formal or long words when easy or short ones will do. Use buy instead of purchase, help instead of assist, about instead of approximately, and so on.

**Write conversationally.** Picture your audience and write as if you were talking to them one-on-one and with the authority of someone who can actively help.

**Hemingway Editor** Use the [Hemingway Editor](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) to make sure your content is readable to an eight grade level. This will help you audience absorb the information you are sharing.
