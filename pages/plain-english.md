**Write content in clear, simple terms. Avoid wordy descriptions and jargon.**

City of Lexington websites are for everyone in the City. The content they contain should therefore be as straightforward as possible.

Don’t use formal or long words when easy or short ones will do. Use buy instead of purchase, help instead of assist, about instead of approximately, and so on.

**Avoid using figurative language.** It often doesn’t say what you actually mean and can make your content more difficult to understand. For example:

* Drive (you can only drive vehicles, not schemes or people)
* Drive out (unless you’re talking about cattle, use get rid of.)
* Going forward (unless you’re giving directions)
* In order to (extra words that usually mean the same thing as “to”)
* One-stop shop (we’re the government, not a big box store)
* In most cases, you can avoid these figures of speech by describing what you’re actually doing. Be open and specific.

**Write conversationally.** Picture your audience and write as if you were talking to them one-on-one and with the authority of someone who can actively help.
