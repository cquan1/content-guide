## Punctuation
There is no alternative to correct punctuation. Incorrect punctuation can change the meaning of a sentence and/or cause the reader to lose track of what is being said and give up reading. The basic guideline to use in punctuation is to use common sense. Punctuation is to make clear the thought being expressed. If it does not help make clear what is being said, it should not be there.


**Apostrophe (')**

Follow these guidelines when using apostrophes.
*	Contractions: You're right. She's a great boss.
*	To show possession: (Place the apostrophe before the s to show singular possession) Ms. Smith's office. 
*	Where the noun that should follow is implied: That was his father's, not his, jacket.
*	To show plural possession, make the noun a plural first. Then immediately use the apostrophe.  the two boys' hats, the Joneses' house
*	Do not use an apostrophe for the plural of a name. We visited the Smiths in Louisville. The Billingsleys have two dogs and a cat.
*	With a singular compound noun, show possession with the 's at the end of the word. my mother-in-law's car
*	If the compound noun is plural, form the plural first and then use the apostrophe. my two brothers-in-law's hats
*	Use the apostrophe and s after the second name only if two people possess the same item. Michael and Cindy's home is constructed of brick. Stacey's and Jon's contracts will be renewed next year.
*	Never use an apostrophe with possessive pronouns: his, hers, its, theirs, ours, yours, whose.  They already show possession so they do not require an apostrophe.  The book is hers, not yours.  
*	The only time an apostrophe is used for it's is when it is a contraction for "it is" or "it has." It's your right to refuse the invitation. It's been great getting to know you.


**Ampersand (&)**

Do not use the ampersand (&) as an abbreviation for and. Use the ampersand when it is part of a company's formal name or composition title:  


> *Procter & Gamble*  

The ampersand should not otherwise be used in place of and: 

> *Division of Facilities and Fleet Management*
>
> **-NOT-**
>
> *Division of Facilities & Fleet Management*


**Semicolon (;)**
A semicolon serves as a strong comma, and is usually used to clarify a series.
*	To clarify a series:  When individual segments contain material that also must be set off by commas:  He leaves a daughter, Sidney Brown of Lexington; three sons, Johnny Smith of Dallas, Tim Smith of Louisville, Ky., and Randy Smith of Nashville, Tenn.; and a sister, Dorothy McAdams, of Richmond, Ky.
*	To link independent clauses: When a coordinating conjunction such as and, but or for is not present.

> **_Incorrect_:**  *The package was due last week, it arrived today.*
>
>	**_Correct_:**  *The package was due last week; it arrived today.*


**Colon (:)**

The most common use of the colon is at the end of a sentence to introduce lists, tabulations, examples, series, etc.  

> *Several people attended the meeting: Callie, Cory, Ryan, Janie and Landon.*


**Comma (,)**

The following guidelines treat some of the most frequent questions about the use of commas.  

Use commas after introductory clauses, phrases or words that come before the main clause. Common starter words for introductory clauses that should be followed by a comma include after, although, as, because, if, since, when and while.

> *Because her alarm was broken, she was late for work.*
> *If you are not feeling well, you need to go home.*

Use a pair of commas in the middle of a sentence to set off clauses, phrases and words that are not essential to the meaning of the sentence. Use one comma before to indicate the beginning of the pause and one at the end to indicate the end of the pause.
That Tuesday, which happens to be my birthday, is the only day when I am available to meet.
